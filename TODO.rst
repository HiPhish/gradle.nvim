 Things left to be done
########################

- Pick the working directory in a more intelligent way; perhaps allow passing
  arguments to the remote plugin?
- Lazy loading of the plugin
- Allow setting the JVM process? Maybe not, Gradle can use a different JVM for
  running builds already
- Write user guide
- Provide other communication mechanism as an option (e.g. network socket)
